  This is a Left Hand Mini 1800 style keyboard that was my first project to learn PCB design through KiCAD. The PCB design is based around a ProMicro and daughter board which uses USB mini-B similar to the [Tanuki Keyboard](https://github.com/SethSenpai/Tanuki). The PCB only supports the layout that is shown in the image above. Please feel free to modify the PCB or case files to fit your needs. 

 # Case

 The case is a typical top mounted desin with the intention for it to be 3D printed with the mounting solution being M2 heat-set inserts and screws. I sourced my hardware from McMaster-Carr:
